1. In order to properly use the secure message system, you must first ssh into another computer.

2. On one computer, create the "Bob" process by executing target.py using the command:
./target.py


3. On the other computer, create the "Alice" process by executing shooter.py using the command:
./shooter.py [IP address of Bob]

4. Provide a very short AES key password. For some reason, the execution permissions for these programs were stripped away on my WWU CS account. Therefore I was not able to implement and test arbitrary input length with confidence. I ask that you put in a 3 character password, since that is what is guaranteed to work.

5. You can now send messages back and forth for as long as you want. To properly exit the program, just type in exit for either program.
